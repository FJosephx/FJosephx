# Hello! I'm Franco Unda



## ðŸš€ About Me
I am Franco Unda, a computer engineering student.

I'm passionate about project management and development, but also programming!

My main projects are based on web development with database integration.

Each of these projects seek to approach the real world of the IT industry. 
For example:
- Project management platform.
- E-Commerce platform for product sales.

I also have repositories with projects where I experiment with new technologies, I like to learn new things and test my skills!

I must emphasize that I have taken courses to improve and take advantage of the use of artificial intelligence for the automation of processes and tasks when developing and documenting projects, it is a complement and a great ally in these times, but we should not depend on it!
